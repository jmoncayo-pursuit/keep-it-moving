# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Keep-It-Moving (KIM) is a local-first solution that enables developers to send text prompts from any device (phone, tablet, laptop) to VS Code's GitHub Copilot chat. The system provides a secure, joyful remote coding experience with animated pairing, emoji-driven feedback, and playful interactions while maintaining complete local network operation without cloud dependencies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to send code prompts from my phone to VS Code's Copilot chat, so that I can query Copilot remotely while brainstorming away from my development machine.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a prompt from their phone THEN the system SHALL relay the prompt to VS Code's Copilot chat panel within 2 seconds
2. WHEN the prompt is successfully delivered THEN the phone SHALL display a success notification with emoji feedback (üöÄ)
3. WHEN the prompt fails to deliver THEN the phone SHALL display an error message with playful emoji (üêõ)
4. WHEN using a phone THEN the system SHALL support pairing via animated QR code with bouncing cursor animation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to pair my devices securely without cloud services, so that I can maintain privacy and work offline while enjoying a quick setup experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pairing a phone THEN the system SHALL display an animated QR code with playful visuals in VS Code
2. WHEN pairing a laptop or tablet THEN the system SHALL provide a 6-digit manual code entry option
3. WHEN a device is paired THEN the system SHALL use UUID token-based authentication for all communications
4. WHEN pairing is complete THEN the setup process SHALL take less than 2 minutes
5. WHEN communicating THEN all traffic SHALL remain on the local network using WebSocket connections

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want emoji-based status notifications and playful interactions, so that I can enjoy a delightful coding experience with immediate feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a prompt is sent THEN the device SHALL show emoji status (üì§ for sending, üöÄ for success)
2. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL display playful error messages like "Code took a coffee break! ‚òï"
3. WHEN in "vibe check" mode THEN the system SHALL generate random code quips like "Your code's got swagger!"
4. WHEN the desktop tray is active THEN it SHALL display current status with appropriate emojis
5. WHEN a prompt is received THEN the device SHALL show a toast notification confirming receipt

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a responsive web interface that works on all my devices, so that I can send prompts from phones, tablets, and laptops with a consistent experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing from any device THEN the interface SHALL be a Progressive Web App (PWA)
2. WHEN using different screen sizes THEN the interface SHALL be fully responsive and mobile-first
3. WHEN on any supported browser THEN the app SHALL work on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
4. WHEN interacting with the UI THEN all animations and feedback SHALL be smooth and delightful
5. WHEN typing prompts THEN the interface SHALL provide immediate visual feedback

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to work across different operating systems, so that I can use it regardless of my development environment setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing on any OS THEN the system SHALL support macOS, Windows, and Linux
2. WHEN running the relay server THEN it SHALL require Node.js v16 or higher
3. WHEN using VS Code THEN it SHALL require VS Code v1.85+ with GitHub Copilot extension
4. WHEN deploying THEN the runtime SHALL be lightweight (less than 20MB)
5. WHEN setting up THEN the system SHALL provide simple CLI commands for server launch

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reliable prompt delivery with automatic recovery, so that I can trust the system to work consistently during my coding sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the WebSocket connection drops THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt to reconnect
2. WHEN reconnecting THEN the system SHALL display fun messages during the process
3. WHEN prompts are sent THEN the system SHALL achieve 95% relay success rate on LAN
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear, playful error messages
5. WHEN the VS Code extension receives prompts THEN it SHALL inject them into Copilot chat using vscode.postMessage

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation and easy setup, so that I can quickly start using the tool and contribute to its development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the repository THEN it SHALL include a comprehensive README with setup instructions
2. WHEN learning about the tool THEN the README SHALL include a GIF demo showcasing key features
3. WHEN contributing THEN the repository SHALL include contributor guidelines with hackathon vibe
4. WHEN installing THEN the documentation SHALL clearly list all dependencies and requirements
5. WHEN troubleshooting THEN the documentation SHALL include common issues and solutions
