# Adding the Control Panel Screenshot

## Steps to add the screenshot:

1. Save your control panel screenshot as `docs/images/kim-control-panel.png`
2. The image references are already added to:
   - `README.md` (in Quick Start and Extension Commands sections)
   - `ARCHITECTURE.md` (in VS Code Extension section)

## Manual steps:

```bash
# Create the image file from your screenshot
# Save the screenshot you provided as:
cp /path/to/your/screenshot.png docs/images/kim-control-panel.png
```

## Verification:

After adding the image, the documentation will show:
- Control panel interface in the Quick Start guide
- Visual reference in the Extension Commands section
- Architecture documentation with UI screenshot

The image shows the complete KIM control panel with server status, pairing code 309322, and all management controls.
