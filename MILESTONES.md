# Keep-It-Moving: Development Milestones

## Project Overview
Keep-It-Moving (KIM) enables developers to send prompts from any device to VS Code's GitHub Copilot chat. The project showcases innovative architecture and engineering solutions.

## Technical Achievements

### Embedded Server Architecture
Successfully embedded a full WebSocket server inside a VS Code extension:
- Embedded Node.js WebSocket server directly in extension
- Dynamic port discovery with intelligent fallbacks
- Zero external dependencies or processes
- One-click setup experience

### Self-Hosting PWA
Extension serves its own complete web interface:
- Complete PWA embedded in extension code
- QR codes point to extension's own server
- Auto-pairing from URL parameters
- Self-contained system

### Security Implementation
Implemented authentication without complexity:
- UUID v4 tokens for secure authentication
- Session management with automatic cleanup
- User-friendly error handling
- Local network security

### Real-Time Integration
Direct prompt injection into GitHub Copilot:
- Direct `workbench.action.chat.open` integration
- Sub-second prompt delivery
- Real-time status feedback
- Seamless Copilot experience

## Technical Highlights

### Custom Hook Architecture
Built React-like hooks for VS Code extension context:
```javascript
// Custom connection management
const useEmbeddedServer = (port) => {
    // Dynamic port discovery
    // Connection state management
    // Automatic cleanup
}
```

### Intelligent Port Discovery
```javascript
// Smart fallback system
const portRanges = [
    Array.from({length: 10}, (_, i) => startPort + i),
    [3001, 3002, 4000, 4001, 5000, 5001],
    Array.from({length: 20}, (_, i) => 8100 + i)
];
```

### Embedded PWA Serving
```javascript
// Complete web app in extension
const pwaHtml = `<!DOCTYPE html>...`;
httpServer.on('request', (req, res) => {
    res.end(pwaHtml);
});
```
